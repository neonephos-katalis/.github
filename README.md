## About

Katalis is embedded in the Linux Foundation Europe Project NeoNephos. The NeoNephos Foundation is building an open, secure, and interoperable cloud-edge continuum, empowering stakeholders to collaborate and innovate for Europe’s digital future.

Katalis is inspired by the word "Catalyst", symbolizing transformation, acceleration, and orchestration—key concepts in federated Telco and Kubernetes infrastructure.
If we break it down into a meaningful acronym related to your project’s goals, KATALIS could stand for:
KATALIS – A Conceptual Acronym:
* K – Kubernetes (Cloud-native Orchestration)
* A – API (Bridging Telco APIs and Cloud Provider APIs)
* T – Telecom (Industry Focus)
* A – Automation (Seamless and Automated)
* L – Link (Federation and Integration)
* I – Interoperability (Unifying Telco & IT Cloud Resource Provisioning)
* S – Synchronization (Federated Resource Management)

[SAP ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/) Enter ApeiroRA, a pioneering initiative within the EU's digital policy project, aimed at reshaping cloud-edge interactions. Let's delve into the core elements driving this transformation, from ORD down to Iron- and CobaltCore. These components, alongside projects like Gardener, OCM, and OpenMFP, offer a neutral and open interoperability approach based on existing, well-accepted cloud-native ecosystem standards. Build the future of the cloud-edge continuum together with ApeiroRA.

[GSMA Operator Platform](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/technologies/networks/operator-platform-hp/)
defines a common platform exposing (telco) operator services/capabilities to customers/developers in the 5G-era
in a connect once, connect to many models by a standardisation of a common architecture using a
platform approach for exposing these services.

This project aims to create to bridge between both worlds within the context of [IPCEI-CIS](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/ipcei/approved-ipceis/cloud_en)
and [8ra](https://www.8ra.com/ipcei-cis) european research programs umbrella.

It should enable a cloud edge continuum in both directions:

- The consumption of telco operator compute/storage resources from gardener controlled environments, i.E. to deploy application fragments close the edge of a UE to fulfill latency requirements
- The extension of telco operator federation to software cloud providers resources
